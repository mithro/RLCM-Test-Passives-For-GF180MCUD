# RLCM: Test Passives for GF180MCUD

RLCM is a test chip of on-chip passives in the open-source
[GF180MCU](https://gf180mcu-pdk.readthedocs.io/) process, taped out on the
[wafer.space](https://wafer.space/) GF180MCU Run 2 shuttle. It was designed by
[Ghaith Al Sabagh](https://github.com/EngGhaith)
([Institute for Communications Engineering and RF-Systems](https://www.jku.at/en/institute-for-communications-engineering-and-rf-systems/),
Johannes Kepler University Linz). The project description on wafer.space reads:

> This TO aims to have a kind of test passives to verify the automated openEMS
> flow used to simulate passives on GF180MCUD.

The die carries two metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitors, two spiral
inductors, a symmetric inductor with a centre tap, two transformers, and the
open, joined and thru structures required to de-embed the pads and feed lines
from a measurement. Each structure is connected to its own
[probe launch](#probe-launches), a block of pads in which two ground pads
enclose two or three signal pads, and no structure requires a supply. The
S-parameters measured on silicon can therefore be compared directly with an
electromagnetic (EM) simulation of the same GDS geometry in
[openEMS](https://www.openems.de/). The difference between the two is a
measure of the accuracy of the simulation setup for this process.

## Status

Silicon is expected in November 2026. No measurements exist yet.

## Probe launches

Every structure is connected to a probe launch at the die edge. In this
documentation a launch is a block of ground (G) and signal (S) pads in a
ground-signal-signal-ground (GSSG) or ground-signal-signal-signal-ground
(GSSSG) arrangement. A launch repeats the same pads on several rows at
different pitches, so a structure can be measured with wafer probes of more
than one pitch or wire bonded from the frame row. The two launch types are:

| Launch | Layout cells | Pad order | Used by |
|---|---|---|---|
| Two-port | `Probes_2P`, `Probes_2P_DEEMD` | G S1 S2 G | [^1] [^2] [^8] [^10] [^11] [^12] |
| Three-port | `Probes_3P` | G S1 S2 S3 G | [^3] [^4] [^5] [^6] [^7] [^9] |

The rows of each launch, counted from the die edge inwards, are:

| Row | Pitch (µm) | Pads in a two-port launch | Pads in a three-port launch |
|---|---|---|---|
| Frame row, 58 µm from the die edge | 138 on the top and bottom edges, 152 on the left and right edges | G S1 S2 G | G S1 S2 S3 G |
| Second row, 168 µm in | 125 | G S1 S2 G | G S1 S2 S3 G |
| Third row, 278 µm in | 100 in a two-port launch, 125 in a three-port launch | G S1 S2 G | G S1 S3 G |
| Fourth row, 388 µm in | 100 | none | G S1 S2 S3 G |

![Pad rows of a two-port launch](docs/img/launch_2port.png)

*Pad rows of a two-port launch on the top or bottom edge. On the left and
right edges the frame row has a pitch of 152 µm.*

![Pad rows of a three-port launch](docs/img/launch_3port.png)

*Pad rows of a three-port launch. The third row has no S2 pad.*

All pad openings are 60 µm × 60 µm. The names G, S1, S2 and S3 are used
only in this documentation, because the layout has no pin labels. S1 is the
signal pad with the lowest x or y coordinate. The launch cells, the ground
connections and the pad tables are described under
[Probe launches in `docs/README.md`](docs/README.md#probe-launches).

## MIM capacitors

![The two MIM capacitors on their launches](docs/img/mim_capacitors.png)

The die carries two MIM capacitors between Metal4 (bottom plate) and Metal5
(top plate, through the MIM top plate layer). Each capacitor is a series
element between the two signal pads: S1 connects to the bottom plate and S2
to the top plate.

| # | Top plate (µm) | Area (µm²) | Expected capacitance |
|---|---|---|---|
| [^1] | 100&nbsp;×&nbsp;100 | 10000 | 20 pF (18 pF to 22 pF) |
| [^2] | 54&nbsp;×&nbsp;25 | 1350 | 2.7 pF (2.43 pF to 2.97 pF) |

The full description is under
[MIM capacitors in `docs/README.md`](docs/README.md#mim-capacitors).

### Measurement

The capacitors are probed on two-port launches on the bottom edge, with the
pad order G S1 S2 G. The two-port S-parameters are measured and the launch is
removed using the open and joined launches [^12] and [^11], which use the
same launch cell. After conversion to Y-parameters, the series capacitance
well below self-resonance is `-Im(Y21) / (2πf)`.

### Expected values

The expected capacitance is the top plate area multiplied by the capacitance
per unit area of 2.0 fF/µm² (1.8 fF/µm² to 2.2 fF/µm²) that the
[PDK lists](https://gf180mcu-pdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/analog/spice/elec_specs/elec_specs_6_4.html)
for its densest MIM option, which is the value the `gf180mcuD` tooling
assumes. No EM simulation result is recorded in this repository.

## Spiral inductors

| Two turns [^10] | Four turns [^8] |
|---|---|
| ![Two-turn spiral inductor](docs/img/spiral_2turn.png) | ![Four-turn spiral inductor](docs/img/spiral_4turn.png) |

The two inductors are square spirals with the same 250 µm outer dimension,
26 µm track width and 2 µm spacing. All five metals are stacked and
connected by via arrays along the winding. The inner end is brought out
through an underpass on Metal1 and Metal2 beneath the turns.

| # | Turns | Inner opening (µm) | Expected inductance | Expected DC resistance |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [^10] | 2 | 142 | 1.3 nH | 0.8 Ω |
| [^8] | 4 | 30 | 2.1 nH | 1.2 Ω |

The full description is under
[Spiral inductors in `docs/README.md`](docs/README.md#spiral-inductors). The
two-turn spiral is also available as a stand-alone file in
[`seperate_GDSs/`](seperate_GDSs/README.md#spiral-inductor).

### Measurement

The inductors are probed on two-port launches on the right edge, with the pad
order G S1 S2 G. S1 is the inner end of the spiral and S2 the outer end. The
two-port S-parameters are measured, de-embedded and converted to
Y-parameters. With port 2 grounded, the inductance and quality factor are
`L = Im(1/Y11) / (2πf)` and `Q = Im(1/Y11) / Re(1/Y11)`. The same expressions
applied to `-1/Y21` give the values for the series branch.

### Expected values

The inductance is calculated from the current sheet expression of
[Mohan et al.](https://doi.org/10.1109/4.792620) and the DC resistance from
the
[PDK sheet resistances](https://gf180mcu-pdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/analog/layout/inter_specs/inter_specs_4.html).
Both are hand calculations that ignore the substrate, the ground ring and the
underpass. They are derived under
[Expected values in `docs/README.md`](docs/README.md#expected-values). The
quality factor and the self-resonant frequency can only be obtained from an
EM simulation, and no simulation result is recorded in this repository.

## Symmetric inductor

![Symmetric inductor with centre tap](docs/img/symmetric_inductor.png)

Structure [^9] is a square, two-turn symmetric (differential) inductor with
the same 250 µm outer dimension, 26 µm track width and 2 µm spacing as the
spiral inductors. The two turns exchange position at one crossover, where one
path remains on Metal3 to Metal5 and the other drops to Metal1 and Metal2.
The centre tap is brought out between the two ends.

The full description is under
[Symmetric inductor in `docs/README.md`](docs/README.md#symmetric-inductor).
The inductor is also available as a stand-alone file in
[`seperate_GDSs/`](seperate_GDSs/README.md#symmetric-inductor).

### Measurement

The inductor is probed on a three-port launch on the left edge, with the pad
order G S1 S2 S3 G. S1 and S3 are the two ends of the winding and S2 is the
centre tap. Either the three-port S-parameters are measured, or a two-port
measurement is made on S1 and S3 using the third pad row, which has no S2
pad. The differential inductance is `Im(Zdiff) / (2πf)` with
`Zdiff = Z11 + Z22 - Z12 - Z21` between the two ends. The launch is removed
using [^6] and [^7].

### Expected values

The expected inductance is about 1.3 nH end to end, from the same hand
calculation as for the two-turn spiral, which does not model the crossover or
the centre tap. No EM simulation result is recorded in this repository.

## Transformers

| One turn per winding [^3] | Two turns per winding [^5] |
|---|---|
| ![Transformer with one turn per winding](docs/img/transformer_1turn.png) | ![Transformer with two turns per winding](docs/img/transformer_2turn.png) |

Each of the two transformers consists of two interleaved windings with
crossovers. Both are placed in the middle of the die between a three-port
launch on the left edge and one on the right edge, and are connected to each
launch by three Metal5 feed lines.

![Transformer 3 between its two launches](docs/img/transformer_row.png)

*Transformer 3 with its feed lines, ground rails and launches.*

The windings are named A and B in this documentation. Their terminals are
assigned to the launch pads as follows:

| # | Rings | Track (µm) | Left launch | Right launch |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [^3] | 2 | 26 | S1 and S3: ends of winding A. S2: centre tap of winding B | S1 and S3: ends of winding B. S2: centre tap of winding A |
| [^5] | 4 | 24 | S1 and S3: ends of winding A. S2: centre tap of winding A | S1 and S3: ends of winding B. S2: centre tap of winding B |

The full description is under
[Transformers in `docs/README.md`](docs/README.md#transformers).

### Measurement

Each transformer is probed on three-port launches on the left and right
edges, with six signal pads in total. A full characterisation is a six-port
measurement. With a four-port network analyser, the four winding ends are
measured on the third pad row of each launch, which has no S2 pad, and the
centre taps are left open. The launches and feed lines are removed using
[^4], [^6] and [^7]. The winding inductances are obtained from `Im(Z)` of
each winding, and the coupling factor from
`k = Im(Z21) / sqrt(Im(Z11) Im(Z22))` with each winding treated as one
differential port.

### Expected values

No expected values are recorded. No hand estimate is given because the
closed-form expression used for the spiral inductors does not cover
interleaved windings. The winding inductances, the coupling factor and the
self-resonant frequency can only be obtained from an EM simulation.

## De-embedding structures

A measurement of any of the passives includes the pads and feed lines of its
launch. The five de-embedding structures are launches without a device, so
that the contribution of the launch can be measured and removed.

| # | Launch | Signal pads |
|---|---|---|
| [^11] | Two-port | S1 joined to S2 |
| [^12] | Two-port | open |
| [^6] | Three-port | S1, S2 and S3 joined |
| [^7] | Three-port | open |
| [^4] | Three-port, both sides | S1 to S1, S2 to S2 and S3 to S3 through 990 µm lines |

![Two-port launches with the signals joined and open](docs/img/open_short_2port.png)

*Two-port launches on the top edge: structure 11 (left, signals joined) and
structure 12 (right, signals open).*

![Three-port launches with the signals joined and open](docs/img/open_short_3port.png)

*Three-port launches: structure 6 (left edge, signals joined) and structure 7
(right edge, signals open).*

![Three-line thru between two three-port launches](docs/img/thru_3port.png)

*Structure 4, the three-line thru between two three-port launches.*

In [^6] and [^11] the signal pads are joined to each other. The connectivity
extracted from the layout does not show them connected to the ground pads, so
these structures are not a short to ground in the sense of the open-short
method of [Koolen et al.](https://doi.org/10.1109/BIPOL.1991.160985) The
intended de-embedding procedure is not recorded in this repository.

The full description is under
[De-embedding structures in `docs/README.md`](docs/README.md#de-embedding-structures).

### Measurement

Each de-embedding structure is probed in the same way as the device that it
de-embeds, with the same calibration and probe placement. The launch is then
removed with an open-short or thru-based method from the
[further reading](#further-reading-4) of this section.

### Expected values

The open launches are expected to present a small shunt capacitance, and the
joined launches a small series inductance and resistance between the signal
pads. No values are recorded in this repository.

## Simulating the structures

The stated purpose of the chip is to verify an openEMS simulation flow
against silicon. This repository holds only layout. It contains no simulation
scripts, no stack file and no simulated results, and it does not name the
flow. The following components are published elsewhere:

| Component | Location |
|---|---|
| GDS to openEMS workflow | [VolkerMuehlhaus/gds2openEMS](https://github.com/VolkerMuehlhaus/gds2openEMS) |
| GDS to Palace workflow | [VolkerMuehlhaus/gds2palace_ihp_sg13g2](https://github.com/VolkerMuehlhaus/gds2palace_ihp_sg13g2) |
| GF180MCUD stack files for both, by the author of this chip | [`EM-Flow/` in EngGhaith/The-Silent-Owl-GF180MCU-WB-LNA](https://github.com/EngGhaith/The-Silent-Owl-GF180MCU-WB-LNA/tree/main/EM-Flow) |
| Stack viewer | [VolkerMuehlhaus/setupEM](https://github.com/VolkerMuehlhaus/setupEM) |

These workflows take a GDS file, an XML description of the metal and
dielectric stack, and a Python model script. Ports are drawn in the GDS as
polygons on additional layers, by convention 201 and above, and the model
script maps each layer to a port number. The inductor and transformer cells
on this chip carry such polygons on layers 201 to 207. They are the red marks
in the pictures and are listed per cell under
[EM port markers in `docs/README.md`](docs/README.md#em-port-markers).

### Procedure

To produce the expected S-parameters for one structure:

1. Unzip [`RLCMV4_filled.zip`](RLCMV4_filled.zip) and extract the required
   cell, or start from a file in [`seperate_GDSs/`](seperate_GDSs/README.md).
2. Take [`OPENEMS-GF180MCUD-1P5M-TM11KA-MIMB.xml`](https://github.com/EngGhaith/The-Silent-Owl-GF180MCU-WB-LNA/blob/main/EM-Flow/OPENEMS-GF180MCUD-1P5M-TM11KA-MIMB.xml)
   and read the [README next to it](https://github.com/EngGhaith/The-Silent-Owl-GF180MCU-WB-LNA/blob/main/EM-Flow/README.md),
   in particular the note on MIM vias.
3. Write a gds2openEMS model script that maps the port layers to ports,
   following the
   [gds2openEMS user guide](https://github.com/VolkerMuehlhaus/gds2openEMS/blob/main/doc/userguide_md_format/Using_OpenEMS_Python_with_IHP_SG13G2_v3.md).
4. Run the script and compare the resulting Touchstone file with the
   de-embedded measurement.

Steps 3 and 4 have not been carried out as part of this documentation.
